## Description

A geometry drawer that uses object oriented programming to draw a variety of different shapes on a 2D cartesian plane. The program takes input from the user through the console and has features including adding a shape, removing a shape, translating a shape, translating the drawing, saving the drawing to a file, and loading a drawing from a file.

#### Language

- Java

#### Java Docs

All classes and methods are commented using Java Docs and can be viewed through the HTMl files in the folder.

#### Violet UML

Also included in this repository is the Violet UML diagram that I created during the planning stage of this project. It helped me visualize all of the different classes that inherit each other and how everything comes together in one seamless framework.
